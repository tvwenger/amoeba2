Automated Molecular Excitation Bayesian line-fitting Algorithm

`amoeba2` is a Bayesian model of the 1612, 1665, 1667, and 1720 MHz hyperfine transitions of OH written in the [`bayes_spec`](https://github.com/tvwenger/bayes_spec) spectral line modeling framework. `amoeba2` is inspired by [AMOEBA](https://github.com/AnitaPetzler/AMOEBA) and [Petzler et al. (2021)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac2f42).

# Notes on Physics & Radiative Transfer

All models in `amoeba2` apply the same physics and equations of radiative transfer. 

The transition optical depth is taken from [Magnum & Shirley (2015) equation 29](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PASP..127..266M/abstract). The excitation temperature is allowed to vary between transitions (a non-LTE assumption) and clouds. The excitation temperatures of the 1612, 1665, and 1667 MHz transitions are free, whereas that of the 1720 MHz transition is derived from the excitation temperature sum rule.

The radiative transfer is calculated explicitly assuming an off-source background temperature `bg_temp` (see below) similar to [Magnum & Shirley (2015) equation 23](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015PASP..127..266M/abstract). By default, the clouds are ordered from *nearest* to *farthest*, so optical depth effects (i.e., self-absorption) may be present.

Notably, since these are *forward models*, we do not make assumptions regarding the optical depth or the Rayleigh-Jeans limit. These effects are *predicted* by the model. There is one exception: the `ordered` argument, [described below](#ordered).

# Models

The models provided by `amoeba2` are implemented in the [`bayes_spec`](https://github.com/tvwenger/bayes_spec) framework. `bayes_spec` assumes that the source of spectral line emission can be decomposed into a series of "clouds", each of which is defined by a set of model parameters. Here we define the models available in `amoeba2`.

## `TauModel`

`TauModel` is a model that predicts the OH hyperfine optical depth spectra, typically measured via absorption observations. The `SpecData` keys for this model must be "tau_1612", "tau_1665", "tau_1667", and "tau_1720". The following diagram demonstrates the relationship between the free parameters (empty ellipses), deterministic quantities (rectangles), model predictions (filled ellipses), and observations (filled, round rectangles). Many of the parameters are internally normalized (and thus have names like `_norm`). The subsequent tables describe the model parameters in more detail.

## `TauTBModel`

`TauTBModel` is otherwise identical to `TBModel`, except it also predicts the brightness temperature spectra assuming a given background source brightness temperature (where `bg_temp` is in `K` and is supplied during model initialization `TBTauModel(bg_temp=2.7)`). The `SpecData` keys for this model must be "tau_1612", "tau_1665", "tau_1667", "tau_1720", "TB_1612", "TB_1665", "TB_1667", and "TB_1720". The following diagram demonstrates the model, and the subsequent table describe the additional model parameters.

## `ordered`

An additional parameter to `set_priors` for these models is `ordered`. By default, this parameter is `False`, in which case the order of the clouds is from *nearest* to *farthest*. Sampling from these models can be challenging due to the labeling degeneracy: if the order of clouds does not matter (i.e., the emission is optically thin), then each Markov chain could decide on a different, equally-valid order of clouds.

If we assume that the emission is optically thin, then we can set `ordered=True`, in which case the order of clouds is restricted to be increasing with velocity. This assumption can *drastically* improve sampling efficiency. When `ordered=True`, the `velocity` prior is defined differently:

| Cloud Parameter<br>`variable` | Parameter | Units    | Prior, where<br>($p_0, p_1, \dots$) = `prior_{variable}`                 | Default<br>`prior_{variable}` |
| :---------------------------- | :-------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `velocity`                    | Velocity  | `km s-1` | $V_i \sim p_0 + \sum_0^{i-1} V_i + {\rm Gamma}(\alpha=2, \beta=1.0/p_1)$ | `[0.0, 1.0]`                  |
